Revive the golden age of arcade games in the 80th with Paulo, the new game from Kurage Studios.

Paul is an original game pushing forward simple but challenging gameplay of yesteryear.

**A little background**

Paulo is monitoring a site overnight but it isn’t exactly going smoothly…
Blocks of bricks are falling from the sky!

While avoiding getting knocked, Paulo is trying to align blocks to destroy the wall.

Please help him !

**How to play?**

● Touch the left or the right of the screen to move Paulo by one space.  
● Blocks can be pushed.  
● Bricks and boxes can be destroyed by making a horizontal line without gaps.  
● Bombs destroy everything on the line.  
● The destruction of a box gives an object.  
● Pick objects by jumping on them.  
● Locks are opened with keys.  
● Beware of mushrooms!
