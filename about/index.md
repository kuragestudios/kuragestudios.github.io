Kurage Studios is not yet a company but we are working hard to found it soon.

We are a group of passionate indie game makers!

### We love games

We love to play games and we love to make games.
At the studio, we encourage our people to experiment, play and share new games.

> Creativity is intelligence having fun. (Albert Einstein)

### iOS & Android

For the time being, we develop games exclusively on the mobile platform. However, we hope to develop for home consoles in the coming years.
